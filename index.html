            <h3>Attendance System Using Face Recognition</h3>
            <p>This project is a web-based attendance system leveraging face recognition technology for marking and tracking attendance. It combines Flask (backend) and OpenCV (frontend) to create a robust and user-friendly application.</p>
            <p>This project utilizes Python as the core programming language, leveraging Flask for backend development to handle routing, user authentication, and server-side logic. The OpenCV library is used for real-time video processing and face detection, while face_recognition is employed for face encoding and recognition tasks. Attendance records are stored and managed using PostgreSQL, ensuring robust database integration. The frontend is built with HTML and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators and users to interact with the system seamlessly. </p>

            <h3>Pulse rate and Pulse oximeter monitoring</h3>
            <p>This project implements a real-time pulse rate and SpO2 monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the MAX30105 sensor. The system measures pulse rate and oxygen saturation from the user's fingertip, processes the data using custom algorithms, and displays the results through a web interface hosted by the ESP32.</p>
            <p>The web dashboard shows the current SpO2 levels, pulse rate, and a live graph of data trends. Additionally, an onboard LED provides visual feedback by blinking at a rate proportional to the pulse rate. This project demonstrates an efficient, user-friendly IoT-based solution for continuous health monitoring.</p>

            <h3>Railway Reservation System</h3>
            <p>The Railway Reservation System is a web-based application designed to simplify train booking and management using a combination of modern technologies: Python Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>The Railway Reservation System combines efficient search and booking capabilities with an intuitive user interface. By integrating a database for managing train schedules and passenger details, along with a visually appealing railway map for location selection, this project demonstrates a practical and interactive approach to railway reservations.</p>
